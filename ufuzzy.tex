\title{$\mu$Fuzzy: a highly efficient fuzzy logic library for microcontrollers}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract} 

This paper introduces  a novel fuzzy logic library, named $\mu$Fuzzy,
especially designed for low cost embedded systems.  Although there are other
fuzzy logic libraries available,  the one presented here overcomes some
others' limitations.

It is a lightweight library, written in ANSI C, needing only XXX KB \todo{completar el tamaño de la librería en el abstract}of memory,
which  uses fixed point arithmetic and does not use dynamic memory allocation,
enabling the use of real-time operating systems. These features allow the
library to be implemented in any microcontroller with ARM Cortex-M0 core,
enabling fuzzy logic functions to very low cost devices. It is compatible with
current fuzzy logic tools, and it is free and open source (?).

A comparison with most popular fuzzy logic libraries is made, 

An extensive computational study is carried out and the results are compared with several
algorithms from the literature.
